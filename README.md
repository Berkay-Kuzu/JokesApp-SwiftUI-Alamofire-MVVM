# JokesApp-SwiftUI-Alamofire-MVVM
This is an app built with SwiftUI and designed with MVVM design pattern. I formed Model file with structs which have Identifiable protocol and Codable typealias. In SwiftUI, it is obligatory to use Identifiable protocol in order to demonstrate list view on the screen. As for codable typealias, it is combination of decodable and encodable protocols. I used these two protocols for Json decoding and encoding. Moreover, in ViewModel file, I benefited from @Published typealias to connect ViewModel and View files. I created function which I made request with the most frequent used networking 3rd party library Alamofire in this file. In View file, I benefited from @ObservedObject public class to link ViewModel and View files. I showed the taken data in this file to the users in list form.
